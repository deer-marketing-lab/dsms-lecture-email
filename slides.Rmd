# Does Personalization Matter?

---
class: font160
# Business Problem

**Seeking Answers to the following strategic questions:**

* Does adding personalized content improve email effectiveness
    * Personalized content $\rightarrow$ noninformative content

**Data Driven Answers:**

* Randomized Control Trial 
* Varies personalization & across contexts
* Evaluate effects using test of proportions & regression

Discussion based on [Sahni, Wheeler and Chintagunta (2018)](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/epdf/10.1287/mksc.2017.1066)

# Why does this matter? 

* Most businesses engage in this practice 
* Email marketers have access to this information 
* Can impact consumer response via 'psychological mechanisms'

*Psychological mechanisms!?*

* [**A**] Drawing **a**ttention to the email 
* [**O**] Shape **o**pinions of reciever / positive cue
* [**E**] Increased **e**laboration ... via recipient processing

---
class: font160
# From 'Psychology' to Outcomes 

Different mechanisms $\rightarrow$ different patterns in outcome variables 

* Increased **opens** of personalized emails 
  * Consistent with A, O, E

* **Unsubscriptions** 
  * Increase under A, decrease under O and E

* **Leads**
  * increase under E and O ...
  * ... more evidence for E if even more leads when a discount mentioned

# The Experiments

url <- "figs/swc_experiments.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)

# Experiment 1: Context 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="70%"}
url <- "figs/experiment_1_email.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

.center[
$\implies$ ** Focus: acquiring new customers**
]

---
class: font160
# Experiment 1: Design

**Control Group**: Typical email, no name added to subject line 

Eg: "Learn Financial Modeling from Industry Experts"

**Treatment Group**: Names explicitly added to email's subject line 

Eg: "Jack, Learn Financial Modeling from Industry Experts"

---
# Experiment 1: Results

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
url <- "figs/experiment_1_results.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)

# Experiment 2: Context 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="50%"}
url <- "figs/experiment_2_email.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

.center[
$\implies$ **Focus: Re-engaging old customers**
]


---
# Experiment 2: Design

**Control Group**: No name in subject line

**Treatment Group**: 'Usual' email, contains name in subject line 

**Outcome**: clicks on link

---

# Experiment 4: Mechanisms

Identify whether mechanism related to: 

* **"increasing elaboration"**
  * noninformative content increases message processing 
* **"serving as a positive cue"** 
  * noninformative content increases the recipients liking of the advertiser.

# Experiment 4: Design

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="70%"}
url <- "figs/experiment_4_design.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

**Doesn't mention discount size** due to worries of being spam filtered

---
# Experiment 4: Context 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
url <- "figs/experiment_4_email.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)

---
# Experiment 4: Results

via ANOVA:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="70%"}
url <- "figs/experiment_4_teststats.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

* **A vs B**: adding name alone has no significant effect
* **B vs D**: adding name in presence of discount increases leads

---
class: font160
# Experiment 4: Results

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
url <- "figs/experiment_4_regression.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

* Cols 1 and 2 support ANOVA results
* Cols 3 to 6 show name increases enagement, discount decreases engagement 

$\implies$ name increases engagement 
$\implies$ via elaboration mechanism

---
class: font160
# Takeaways 

* **Personalized emails increase engagement**
  * ...via increased processing by recipient
* Open questions:
  * **Long run impacts** of advertising? (recall, brand perception etc)
  * Is this still **effective** when **all companies personalize**?

# Targeted Discounts


---
class: font160
# Business Problem

**Seeking Answers to the following strategic questions:**

* How should we think about targeted email offers?
  * Treated as a "coupon"? $\rightarrow$ targets price sensitive consumers
  * Generate attention to the company?  $\rightarrow$ "advertising effect"
  * Some combination of both? 

**Data Driven Answers**:

* Randomized Control Trials ... 70!
* Anonymous ticket resale platform

---
class: font160
# The Experiment

* 70 experiments targeting over 100 individuals

* Within each potential recipients randomized between 
  * **Treatment**: Recieving an offer (discount)
  * **Control**: Not recieving an offer (discount)

---
# The Firm Targets 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="40%"}
url <- "figs/targeted_disc_targeting.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

---
# But Randomization Checks are OK

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
url <- "figs/targeted_disc_randomization.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

# Average Expenditure

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="60%"}
url <- "figs/targeted_discount_exp_kernel.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

.center[
**Average expenditure increases when targeted with discount**
]

---
# Average Effect of an Offer

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="70%"}
url <- "figs/targeted_disc_avg_effect.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

* 3.03: the average dollar increase in expenditure between Treatment and Control
**2.81: the average dollar increase in expenditure when not using the offer in the Treatment Group versus the Control

**Effects also where consumers do not use the offer!**

---
# Who Responds? 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="50%"}
url <- "figs/targeted_disc_who_responds.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

Effects largest where:

* More transactions in the past 
* Longer since last transaction

... these are correlations

---
class: font160
# Longer-Term Effects

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
url <- "figs/targeted_disc_long_term.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

.center[
Spent more on average for upto 4 weeks after offer sent 
]

---
class: font160
# Cross-Category Spillovers 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
url <- "figs/targeted_disc_spillovers.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

.center[
Effect spills over to category (MLB) not eligible for discounts
]

---
class: font160
# Takeaways

* **Targeted Offers increase spending by 37.2%**
  * 90% of this is **not** on redeeming coupons 

* Effect carries over in the short run ...
  * ... and across categories 

$\implies$ consistent with a reminder effect

**Potential implication**: firms can gain from the targeted promotions even without having to incur the costs associated with the discounts

* Need to investigate generalizability of this 

---
class: inverse, center, middle

# Recap 

---
class: font160
# Summary

* Email personalization matters 
  * Mechanism at play is via increased message processing of consumers

* Emails with discounts lead to increased spending 
  * Often on items where the discount does not apply

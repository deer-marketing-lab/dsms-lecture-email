# What do we want to know? 

1. Does Personalization Matter? 
  * Discussion based on [Sahni, Wheeler & Chintagunta](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/epdf/10.1287/mksc.2017.1066)

2. What do Targeted Discounts Do?
  * Discussion based on [Sahni, Zou & Chintagunta](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/epdf/10.1287/mnsc.2016.2450)

# Does Personalization Matter?

---
# Business Problem

**Seeking Answers to the following strategic questions:**

* Does adding personalized content improve email effectiveness
    * Personalized content $\rightarrow$ noninformative content

Data Driven Answers:

* Randomized Control Trial 
* What paper does 
* Evaluate effects using YYY

Discussion based on [Sahni, Wheeler and Chintagunta (2018)](link TBA)

---
# Why this matters 

* Most businesses engage in this practice 
* Email marketers have access to this information 
* Can impact consumer response via 'psychological mechanisms'

Psychological mechanisms!?

* [**A**] Drawing **a**ttention to the email 
* [**O**] Shape **o**pinions of reciever / positive cue
* [**E**] Increased **e**laboration ... via recipient processing

---
# From 'Psychology' to Outcomes 

Different mechanisms $\rightarrow$ different patterns in outcome variables 

* Increased opens of personalized emails 
  * Consistent with A, O, E

* Unsubscriptions 
  * Increase under A, decrease under O and E

* Leads
  * increase under E and O ...
  * ... more evidence for E if even more leads when a discount mentioned

# The Experiments 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/swc_experiments.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

---
# Experiment 1: Context 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="70%"}
url <- "figs/experiment_1_email.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

.center[
$\implies$ ** Focus: acquiring new customers**
]

---
# Experiment 1: Design

Control Group: Typical email, no name added to subject line 

Eg: "Learn Financial Modeling from Industry Experts"

Treatment Group: Names explicitly added to email's subject line 

Eg: "Jack, Learn Financial Modeling from Industry Experts"

---
# Experiment 1: Results

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
url <- "figs/experiment_1_results.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

---
# Experiment 2: Context 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="50%"}
url <- "figs/experiment_2_email.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

.center[
$\implies$ **Focus: Re-engaging old customers**
]


---
# Experiment 2: Design

Control Group: No name in subject line

Treatment Group: 'Usual' email, contains name in subject line 

Outcome: clicks on link

---
# Experiment 2: Results 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
url <- "figs/experiment_2_results.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)

# Experiment 3: Context 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="45%"}
url <- "figs/experiment_3_email.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```
.center[
$\implies$ **Focus: Monthly newsletter**
]

---
# Experiment 3: Design

Control Group: Typical email, no name added to subject line 

Treatment Group: Names explicitly added to email's subject line 

Outcome: clicks on link

url <- "figs/experiment_3_results.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

# Experiment 4: Searching for a Mechanism

Identify whether mechanism related to: 

* "increasing elaboration" 
  * noninformative content increases message processing 
* "serving as a positive cue" 
  * noninformative content increases the recipients liking of the advertiser.

# Takeaways 

* Personalized emails increase engagement
* via increased processing by recipient
* Open questions:
  * Long run impacts of advertising? (recall, brand perception etc)
  * Is this still effective when all companies personalize?

# Targeted Discounts


---
# Business Problem

**Seeking Answers to the following strategic questions:**

* How should we think about targeted email offers?
  * Treated as a "coupon"? $\rightarrow$ targets price sensitive consumers
  * Generate attention to the company?  $\rightarrow$ "advertising effect"
  * Some combination of both? 

Data Driven Answers:

* Randomized Control Trials .. 70!
* Anonymous ticket resale platform
* Evaluate effects using YYY

---
# The Experiment

* 70 experiments targeting over 100 individuals

* Within each potential recipients randomized between 
  * Recieving an offer (discount)
  * Not recieving an offer (discount)

---
# The Firm Targets 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="40%"}
url <- "figs/targeted_disc_targeting.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

---
# But Randomization Checks are OK

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
url <- "figs/targeted_disc_randomization.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

---
# Average Expenditure Between Treatments

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="60%"}
url <- "figs/targeted_discount_exp_kernel.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

---
# Average Effect of an Offer

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="70%"}
url <- "figs/targeted_disc_avg_effect.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

**Effects also where consumers do not use the offer!**

---
# Who Responds? 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="60%"}
url <- "figs/targeted_disc_who_responds.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

(correlation)

---
# Longer-Term Effects

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
url <- "figs/targeted_disc_long_term.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

---
# Cross-Category Spillovers 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
url <- "figs/targeted_disc_spillovers.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

---
# Takeaways

* Targeted Offers increase spending by 37.2%
  * 90% of this is **not** on redeeming coupons 

* Effect carries over in the short run ...
  * ... and across categories 

$\implies$ consistent with a reminder effect

Potential implication: firms can gain from the targeted promotions even without having to incur the costs associated with the discounts

* Need to investigate generalizability of this
